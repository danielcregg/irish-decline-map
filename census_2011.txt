Foreword

This report presents for the first time comprehensive census of population results for both Ireland and
Northern Ireland in a single publication, the result of close collaboration between the statistical services
in both jurisdictions – the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and the Northern Ireland Statistics and
Research Agency (NISRA). This publication draws together results from both censuses and explores
both similarities and differences in the two populations as well as looking at how these populations
have changed over time.

The timing of the censuses, just two weeks apart, on 27 March 2011 in Northern Ireland and 10 April
2011 in Ireland, offered a rare opportunity to present a detailed picture of the population of both
jurisdictions at a single point in time. The publication presents analysis across a range of topics in areas
such as demographics, households, ethnicity, place of birth, religion, health, unpaid care, housing and
travel to work, school or college.

While the results from both censuses are broadly comparable on most topics, some important
differences exist, notably in areas such as economic status (where different approaches have been used
in the questionnaires) and education (where both the system of qualifications and the questions asked
mean only high level comparisons have been possible). The approach taken in examining these, and
indeed all topics, is outlined in detail in Appendices 3 and 4.

Extensive use is made of thematic maps throughout the report to illustrate the differences in the
populations in different geographic areas across the island; Counties (and City Councils) have been used
for Ireland while Local Government Districts (LGD) have been used for Northern Ireland.  A section on
cross-border travel is also included and presents results for the first time on persons commuting to
work or study on either side of the border.

We trust that this publication will be of value to all government departments and agencies, as well as to
the cross-border bodies established under the Belfast Agreement. The report should also prove
valuable to anyone with an interest in the dynamics of population and social change in the two
jurisdictions.

This report is published on the CSO and NISRA websites and is also available in hard copy from both
organisations.

Introduction



‘Census 2011 Ireland and Northern Ireland’ has been jointly prepared by the Central Statistics Office
(CSO) in Ireland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA).

Censuses of Population have been conducted on the island of Ireland since 1841. Since 1946, Ireland
has undertaken a census at five-yearly intervals, with the exceptions of 1976 and 2001. In Northern
Ireland the census remains a decennial exercise, taking place every decade during the year ending in 1.
For the first time in 2011 the censuses in both jurisdictions were conducted under EU regulation
(Regulation (EC) No. 763/2008), which set out the topics to be covered in all Member States of the EU.
Additionally, the timing of the 2011 Census in Northern Ireland on 27th March, and in Ireland two weeks
later on 10th April, is the first time that censuses have been taken on both sides of the border in the
same year since 1991.

The primary purpose of a census of population is to establish how many people there are in a country.
The Northern Ireland census and subsequent mid-year population estimates are based on the usually
resident population. Thus, people are recorded at the address where they are usually resident
irrespective of where they are on census night. In Ireland, on the other hand, the main census results
are reported on the de facto population, that is, persons are enumerated where they spend census night.
A limited number of additional questions are included about the usual residents at each address who
were temporarily absent on census night, thereby enabling key demographic statistics to be produced
on a usually resident basis. The main demographic results included in this publication in relation to
Ireland are based on the de facto population, however some results are based on the usually resident
population and are indicated as such in the relevant titles and text. In practice the difference between
these de facto and usually resident measures is not significant.

The report aims to present a broad, comprehensive picture of the population of Ireland and Northern
Ireland, comparing not just the demographic characteristics, but also exploring themes such as housing,
ethnicity, place of birth, household structures, health, unpaid carers, economic status, industry and
occupation of work, education, language and travel to and from work, school and college. Some
remarkable similarities can be found in the populations of Ireland and Northern Ireland, while areas of
strong dissimilarity are also present; for example, Northern Ireland has an older population than
Ireland, while a larger proportion of Ireland’s population was born elsewhere.

The information in the report is sourced mainly from the census, although some data from other
statistical sources are also included, particularly in relation to historical data. The information in this
report is by and large presented graphically or in small snapshot tables, accompanied by brief
commentary. The results of the 2011 censuses in Ireland and Northern Ireland have been extensively
published and are available to view and download on the websites of the CSO (www.cso.ie/census) and
NISRA (www.nisra.gov.uk/census and www.ninis.nisra.gov.uk) respectively.

Population of the island of Ireland

In 2011 the population of the island
of Ireland stood at 6.4 million
persons. This comprised populations
of 4.6 million in Ireland, accounting
for 72 per cent of the total, and 1.8
million in Northern Ireland,
representing the remaining 28 per
cent of the total population of the
island.  (Table 1)

Looking back over the past century
the share of the island’s population in
Northern Ireland increased from 28
per cent in 1901 to a peak of  34 per
cent  in 1971, generally declining
slowly thereafter to 28 per cent in
2011. (Figure 1)

This has come about as a result of
stronger population growth in
Ireland, particularly over the last
decade. Since 2002 the population in
Ireland has grown by 17 per cent,
two and a half times the rate of
growth in Northern Ireland (6.9) per
cent.

Population change

Figure 2 shows the changing
patterns of intercensal
population growth in both
jurisdictions over the past sixty
years. Ireland experienced
population decline of 4.8 per
cent between 1951 and 1961,
compared with 4.0 per cent
growth in Northern Ireland.
While Ireland’s population
increased by 5.7 per cent during
the sixties, population growth in
Northern Ireland was higher, at
7.9 per cent. The seventies saw a
reversal of this pattern when
unusually high levels of inward
migration at the end of the
decade saw double digit
population growth of 16 per
cent in Ireland, while Northern
Ireland’s population level was
static.

Since then, population growth in
Ireland has exceeded that in
Northern Ireland, apart from a
brief period of net outward
migration from Ireland during
the late 1980s. (Table 2)





The population of Ireland has
grown faster than that of
Northern Ireland over the past
6 decades.

Ireland

Table 3 shows the population by sex for both Ireland and Northern Ireland and the changing patterns in the
numbers of males and females over the past 110 years. During periods of high outward migration the
population of males typically falls relative to that of females and accordingly larger decreases in the number
of males (6.0 per cent) compared with females (3.6 per cent) were recorded in Ireland throughout the
1950s.  During this period, however, the numbers of males and females living in Northern Ireland grew at
similar rates (4.2 per cent and 3.8 per cent respectively).

Figure 3 shows the ratio of males to females since 1901. The contrast in the sex ratio for the two
jurisdictions over the period is stark, with more females than males in Northern Ireland throughout while
in Ireland the reverse was found until the last quarter of a century.   Over time, these ratios have been
tending towards convergence.  For instance, since 1951, the proportion of males per 1,000 females in
Ireland has fallen from 1,036 to 981, while the equivalent ratio in Northern Ireland has risen from 948 to
961.  In Ireland 1986 was the first census to report more females than males and this trend has generally
held since. In Northern Ireland the ratio of males to females has not exceeded 962 in the period since 1901.

Population change by area

Map 1 shows the change in the
population of each administrative area
over the two decades from 1991 to
2011. [See Glossary in Appendix 1 for
description of areas used in maps.] The
highest areas of population growth
were in Counties Fingal (79 per cent),
Meath (75 per cent) and Kildare (71
per cent). Overall, growth rates were
lower in Northern Ireland (13 per cent)
than in Ireland (30 per cent).

More generally the areas of lowest
growth over the period were in the
western and north-eastern coastal
areas in Northern Ireland and in the
larger urban areas of Dublin City and
South Dublin. Belfast (at -4.1 per cent)
and Cork City (at -6.3 per cent) were
the only areas to experience a decline in
population over the two decades.



Sex ratio by area

Map 2 shows the sex ratio in each
administrative area in 2011. While the
overall sex ratio for Northern Ireland
(961) and Ireland (981) shows fewer
males than females, the map shows that
the sex ratio differed significantly
across the island.

Males outnumbered females in large
areas of the west, the midlands and
border areas. The areas with the lowest
sex ratios were concentrated in urban
areas and along the east coast of the
island, with the lowest rates found in
Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown (915),
Castlereagh (922), Newtownabbey
(927), North Down (928) and Belfast
(928).

Population size by area

In 2011 Dublin City had the largest population with
527,600, followed by Cork County (399,800), Belfast
(280,900), Fingal (274,000) and South Dublin (265,200).
The areas with the smallest populations were Moyle
(17,100), Ballymoney (31,300) and Leitrim (31,800).

Population density

In 2011 the population density of Northern Ireland was 134
persons per square kilometre; double that of Ireland (67).
Overall population density for the island as a whole stood at
78 persons per sq. km, an increase of 25 per cent since
1991.  However, strong population growth in Ireland has
seen the population density increase by 30 per cent since
1991 while slower population growth in Northern Ireland
has resulted in a 13 per cent rise over that period. Figure 4
shows the change in population density between 1991 and
2011.

Table 4 shows the population density in administrative
areas and clearly illustrates, as might be expected, that the
most densely populated areas were in the cities and
surrounding areas, topped by Dublin (4,526), Cork (3,090)
and Belfast (2,567).

Although Northern Ireland was more densely populated,
there was greater variation within Ireland in terms of
population density.  Seven of the eight most densely
populated areas on the island were city council areas in
Ireland, while most of the least densely populated areas,
including Roscommon (26), Mayo (24) and Leitrim (21),
were also in Ireland.

The population pyramid in Figure 5 shows the age structure of both countries.

In Ireland, the particularly high birth rate in 1979 - 1981 (32 and 33 year olds in
2011) are clearly evident, as is the decline in births over the subsequent fifteen
years. The recent recovery in births is also well illustrated.

In Northern Ireland, the picture is more varied. Births rose above 30,000 for a
sustained period from the late 1950s until the early 1970s, peaking in 1964 with
34,300 births.  They then started to fall, reaching a low of 21,400 in 2002. Recent
years show a recovery in births, in line with trends in Ireland and Great Britain.

The pyramid shape from age 40 and over reflects the effects of mortality on the
population while the presence of disproportionately more older people in
Northern Ireland than in Ireland can be seen.

In the older age groups greater female life expectancy is evident in the
population of both jurisdictions with proportionally more females than males
aged 65 and over. Males in this age group accounted for 6.4 per cent of the
population in Northern Ireland, compared with females at 8.3 per cent, while the
corresponding figures for Ireland were 5.3 per cent and 6.4 per cent for males
and females respectively.




In 2011, young
people accounted
for a greater share
of the population
in Ireland while
there were
disproportionately
more older people
in Northern
Ireland.

Median age

The median age is the age about which half of the
population is younger and half is older. In 2011 the
median age of the population of Ireland was 34, the
lowest of any EU Member State. The median age in
Northern Ireland, while higher at 37, was also
considerably lower than the EU average of 41.

Map 3 presents the different median ages across
the island in 2011 and illustrates the older
population in Northern Ireland.  The highest
median age can be seen in eastern areas of
Northern Ireland, in particular in Ards,
Castlereagh, Larne and North Down at 41. The
lowest median age of 31 was found in Galway City.

Figure 6 charts the change in median age from
1926 to 2011. While the divergence between
Ireland and Northern Ireland is clearly illustrated,
the median ages show similar trajectories in both
jurisdictions with the populations ageing from
1971 onwards for women, and from 1981 onwards
for men, reflecting the respective improvements in
life expectancy for both sexes.




The median age
in Northern
Ireland was 37
years, compared
with 34 years in
Ireland.

Age dependency

Figure 7, which presents the share of the population of
people in young, working age and older age groups in 2011,
shows that Northern Ireland had proportionately more
older people and Ireland had proportionately more young
people.

Age dependency ratios are used to give an indication of the
age structure of the population, with young (0-14 years) and
older people (65 years and over) expressed as a percentage
of the population of working age (15-64).  In 2011, the
dependency ratios for Northern Ireland and Ireland were 52
and 49 per cent respectively.  This compares with the EU
average of 49 per cent.

Figure 8 shows trends in dependency ratios over the period
since 1926, charting the young and older elements which
made up the overall dependency ratio. It is interesting to
note the fall in the overall rate between 1971 and 2002,
mainly driven by a fall in young dependency ratios over the
period, while older dependency ratios continued to
gradually increase. Although overall dependency has
levelled off in Ireland over the last decade, reflecting a
recent increase in the birth rate, it has continued to decline
in Northern Ireland, where the reduction in young
dependency continues to exceed the growth in the older
population.

Dependency by area

Age dependency varied greatly across
different areas depending on the age
structure.  Map 4 shows the age
dependency by geographical area in 2011
and illustrates that dependency was
highest in rural areas, particularly in the
north west of Ireland, reaching a peak of 57
per cent in Leitrim, and lowest in the cities
and surrounding areas.

Table 5 shows the areas with the highest
and lowest rates of young, older and overall
dependency. It is interesting to note the
range of both young and older dependency
across different areas.  Young dependency
is lowest in the cities and highest in those
counties which have experienced most
population growth over the last decade.
Older dependency was highest in the east
of Northern Ireland and lowest in the
Dublin commuter belt and in Galway City,
where, for the latter, low levels of both
young and older dependency contribute to
the lowest overall dependency rate of 35
per cent.

Figure 9 illustrates young people in broad education
stages as a proportion of the total population.  It
shows that children in the pre-primary or primary age
groups (aged up to 12) represented a larger
proportion of the population of Ireland (19 per cent)
than of that of Northern Ireland (17 per cent),
reflecting the higher birth rates in Ireland, particularly
in recent years.

Map 5 shows that these age groups had a greater
share of the total population in the Dublin commuter
belt and in areas where population growth has been
strongest in recent years. Conversely there were
lower proportions of young people in other city areas
and in the north and east of Northern Ireland.

Figure 10 shows the absolute and percentage change
in the school age population in both jurisdictions since
2002. The high number of births in recent years in
Ireland is reflected in the increase of just under
80,000 (28 per cent) among children aged 0-4. While
Northern Ireland has also seen an increase in this age
group, it has been more modest at 12 per cent.
Northern Ireland has seen a fall in its primary school
aged population of 9.1 per cent, in sharp contrast to
the rise of 16 per cent experienced in Ireland; while
both jurisdictions have seen declines in the secondary
school age groups.

In 2011, young people aged 18 and under
made up 25 per cent of the total population
of Northern Ireland, compared with 26 per
cent of that of Ireland.

Working age groups (aged between 19
and 64 years) made up 60 per cent of
the population in Northern Ireland,
compared with 62 per cent in Ireland.
Figure 11 shows the make-up of these
groups as a percentage of the total
population in both jurisdictions.  In
Ireland, 25-34 year olds formed the
largest working age group – primarily
due to the 1980s baby boom and recent
inward migration - and the share
declined with increasing age. In
Northern Ireland, the share was
relatively even in each age group from
25-34 to 45-54.

Figure 12 shows the change in these
groups between 2002 and 2011. There
was a decrease of 10 per cent in the 19-
24 age group in Ireland, in contrast to
an increase of 10 per cent in Northern
Ireland.  In Ireland, the group aged 55-
64 increased by 32 per cent, while in
Northern Ireland there were increases
of 23 per cent and 16 per cent
respectively in the 45-54 and 55-64 age
groups.

Figure 13 shows males and females in
each older age group as a share of the
total population.  Reflecting its older
age structure, those aged 65 and over
accounted for 15 per cent of Northern
Ireland’s population, compared with
12 per cent of that of Ireland.

At an overall level, females aged 65
and over accounted for 8.3 per cent of
the total population of Northern
Ireland while older men accounted for
6.4 per cent. In Ireland the equivalent
gap was narrower, with 6.4 per cent
for females and 5.3 per cent for males
respectively.

Figure 14 shows females in five year
age groups as a percentage of the total
population in each jurisdiction. The
greater life expectancy of females,
leading to females accounting for a
larger share of the population with
increasing age, is well illustrated,
particularly in Northern Ireland. The
disparity between the sexes is
particularly stark in the oldest age
groups, with females in both
jurisdictions accounting for around
three-fifths of all those aged 80-84,
rising to almost three-quarters of
those aged 90 and over.





In 2011, people aged 65 and over
made up 15 per cent of the total
population of Northern Ireland
compared with 12 per cent of that of
Ireland.

Older people by area

Map 6 presents older age groups as a
share of the total population by area in
2011.   It shows that the highest
proportions of older people were in
Northern Ireland, including 18 per cent of
the total population in North Down, the
highest of any area. In Ireland, Cork City
had the highest share of older people, at
15 per cent. The areas where older people
made up the lowest share of the
population were in the Dublin commuter
belt and Galway City, with the lowest
share recorded at 7.2 per cent in Fingal.

Growth in the older population

The older population is growing at a faster
rate than other age groups.  Figure 15,
which illustrates the growth in older age
groups between 2002 and 2011, shows
that, in both jurisdictions, the highest rate
of growth was seen in the 85 and over age
group; by 40 per cent in Ireland and 34
per cent in Northern Ireland.  Over the
same period, the 65-74 age group
increased in size by 24 per cent in Ireland
and by 18 per cent in Northern Ireland,
while the 75-84 age group saw the lowest
growth rates, with 16 per cent in Ireland
and 11 per cent in Northern Ireland.







Between 2002 and 2011, the older
population in Ireland grew by 23 per
cent compared with a smaller 17 per
cent increase in Northern Ireland.

Figure 16 shows the marital status of the population
aged fifteen years and over in 2011. The majority of
persons in both jurisdictions were either married or
separated. The proportion of single people was higher
in Ireland at 42 per cent, compared with 37 per cent in
Northern Ireland. There was a higher proportion of
widowed people in Northern Ireland (6.7 per cent) than
in Ireland (5.3 per cent), reflecting the different age
structures in each jurisdiction.

Figure 17 looks at trends in marital status of the
population aged fifteen years and over since 1961.
Stemming from a gradual decline of 4.8 percentage
points in Northern Ireland and an increase of 3.1
percentage points in Ireland over the fifty year period,
it shows the marriage (including separated) rates of the
two jurisdictions converging at 51 per cent in 2011.
The proportion of widowed people in Ireland declined
from 8.9 per cent in 1961 to 5.3 per cent in 2011, while
there was a smaller decrease in Northern Ireland from
8.2 per cent to 6.7 per cent over the same period,
possibly due to increased life expectancy of males and
different age profiles in the two jurisdictions.

Among the population aged 15 and over, the proportion
of divorcees has increased over the past 20 years, to 5.4
and 2.4 per cent in Northern Ireland and Ireland
respectively.

Note: Figures for Northern Ireland for 2011 include
current and former registered civil partnerships.

The proportion of persons aged 15 and over
who were married or separated was 51 per
cent in both Ireland and Northern Ireland in
2011.

Change in marital status

The marital status of persons aged 15 and over in the
period 1991-2011 is shown in Table 6.  Figure 18
illustrates the change in marital status between the
2001/2 and 2011 censuses. Northern Ireland saw an
increase of 20 per cent in the number of single people,
nearly double that of population growth among all
persons aged 15 and over (11 per cent), while in
Ireland the increase in single people, at 15 per cent,
was lower than population growth (17 per cent). The
reverse was the case for married people, with
Northern Ireland showing a 3.6 per cent increase
compared with 18 per cent in Ireland.

The greatest proportionate change since 2001/2 has
been amongst divorced persons, with an increase of
150 per cent in Ireland compared with 47 per cent in
Northern Ireland.

 Note: Figures for Northern Ireland for 2011 include
current and former registered civil partnerships.

The share of separated and
divorced persons in both
jurisdictions has increased since
the 2001 census in Northern
Ireland and the 2002 census in
Ireland as shown in Figure 19. In
Ireland in 2002, 98,800 persons
were separated and 35,000
divorced, together accounting for
4.3 per cent of the total
population in Ireland aged 15 and
over. This proportion increased
to 5.7 per cent by 2011 with a
total of 87,800 divorced and
116,200 separated.

The comparable rate for Northern
Ireland in 2011 was 9.3 per cent,
up from 7.8 per cent in 2001, and
consisting of 5.4 per cent
divorced and 3.9 per cent
separated.

Map 7 shows the combined rates
of separation and divorce across
the island of Ireland in 2011. The
highest rates were found in
eastern and northern parts of
Northern Ireland, particularly in
the Belfast and Derry city council
areas with 11 per cent. The
lowest rates generally were along
the western seaboard of Ireland,
notably 4.7 per cent in both
Galway and Limerick counties.


The separated or divorced
status accounted for 9.3 per
cent of people aged 15 years
and over in Northern Ireland
and 5.7 per cent in Ireland.

Northern Ireland.

In 2011, a total of 97,100 usual residents of Northern Ireland were widowed (6.7 per cent of the
population aged 15 and over). The majority of these (89 per cent) were aged 60 and over, accounting for
almost a quarter (24 per cent) of all people aged 60 and over. In Ireland, 191,000 people were widowed
in 2011, accounting for a smaller proportion (5.3 per cent) of the total population aged 15 and over.
Again the majority of these (86 per cent) were aged 60 and over, although they accounted for a lower
overall share (22 per cent) of the 60 and over age group.

In both jurisdictions, the majority of widowed people were female, accounting for 77 per cent in both
Ireland and Northern Ireland.

The 2011 Censuses showed that there were over
1.6 million private households in Ireland and over
700,000 in Northern Ireland. The composition of
these households is shown in Table 7.

The dominant type of household in both
jurisdictions comprised married couples with
children (of any age), accounting for 32 per cent
of households in Ireland and 28 per cent of those
in Northern Ireland as shown in Figure 21.

Cohabiting couples were more prevalent in
Ireland, accounting for 7.7 per cent of households
compared with 5.5 per cent of those in Northern
Ireland.

Families in which all members were aged 65 and
over made up 5.1 per cent of households in
Ireland and 6.7 per cent of those in Northern
Ireland.

Map 8 shows lone parent households as a

(Northern Ireland). It illustrates the higher
prevalence of such households in Northern
Ireland, where Derry had the highest rate, at
20 per cent, followed by Belfast (17 per cent),
while North Down had the lowest rate (11 per
cent).

In Ireland, the highest proportions of lone
parent households were in South Dublin (14
per cent), Limerick City (14 per cent) and
Waterford City (13 per cent), while the lowest
proportion was in Leitrim, at 9.0 per cent.

Lone parent households made up 30 per

Northern Ireland and 24 per cent of those
in Ireland.

Size of households

The average household size in 2011 was 2.73
persons in Ireland, compared with 2.54 in
Northern Ireland. In Ireland, the largest
average household sizes were concentrated
in the Dublin commuter belt area, while the
Magherafelt LGD had the largest average
household size in Northern Ireland.
Households were generally smaller in city
areas as shown in Map 10.

The change in the proportions of large versus
small households between 1961 and 2011 is
illustrated in Figure 22. In Northern Ireland,
households with 5 or more people accounted
for one in ten households in 2011, compared
with 29 per cent fifty years earlier. A similar
pattern can be observed for Ireland, with the
average household size shrinking; the
proportion of households of 5 or more
people fell from 35 per cent in 1961 to 13 per
cent in 2011.







The average
household size has
fallen from 4.0 to
2.7 persons in
Ireland and from
3.7 to 2.5 persons
in Northern
Ireland since
1961.

Figure 23 shows the percentage
share of different religions in
Northern Ireland and Ireland
over the past 150 years. The
changing patterns in the
prevalence rates of the
Protestant and Other Christian
and Catholic religions in
Northern Ireland over the period
can be seen, as can the
predominance of the Catholic
religion in Ireland.

Looking at Northern Ireland, the
proportion of the population
who belonged to Protestant and
Other Christian religions
increased from around three-
fifths in 1861 to around two-
thirds during the first half of the
twentieth century; conversely,
over the same period, the
Catholic share fell from around
two-fifths to around a third.
Since the 1960s, however, the
proportions belonging to these
religions have tended towards
convergence, with that of
Protestant and Other Christians
steadily declining  and that of
Catholics generally increasing
(with the notable exception of
1981, when the census was
subject to a campaign of non-
cooperation in some areas),
reaching respectively 42 per cent
and 41 per cent by 2011.

Over this period, however, their combined share of the usually resident population has fallen from almost
100 per cent to 82 percent, with the remainder in 2011 consisting of less than 1 per cent following other
religions, 10 per cent with no religion and a further 6.8 per cent not stating their religion.

In Ireland, the picture was less mixed with the Catholic religion predominant throughout, albeit showing a
slow decline in more recent years, to reach 84 per cent in 2011. The proportion belonging to Protestant and
Other Christian religions, which accounted for a 10 per cent share up to 1911, has fallen by a third to 6.3 per
cent in 2011. Meanwhile, Other Religions, which accounted for less than 1 per cent up to 1991, increased
their share to 1.9 per cent by 2011, while those with no religion rose to 5.9 per cent, with a further 1.6 per
cent not stating their religion.

The greatest change among those belonging to a
religion in Ireland over the past ten years has
been the rapid rise in the numbers belonging to
Other Religions, which have more than doubled,
albeit from a low base, as illustrated in Figure
24, with 121 per cent growth between 2002 and
2011.   Over the same period, Northern Ireland
also experienced treble-digit growth (202 per
cent) in the proportion of people belonging to
Other Religions (from 0.3 per cent to 0.8 per
cent). The no religion category is examined on
the next page.

Religion and age

The age distribution of religion in 2011 (Figure
25) shows the increasing proportions of
Catholics with age in Ireland, yet declining
proportions in Northern Ireland. The
proportions belonging to Protestant and Other
Christian religions increase with age in Northern
Ireland, while the age distribution of those with
no religion is relatively young in both
jurisdictions.

In Northern Ireland, among the oldest age groups,
Protestants and Other Christians outnumber
Catholics by around 2 to 1, whereas Catholics
outnumber Protestants and Other Christians within
each age group under 40.

The age



























No religion

The higher incidence of no religion in
Northern Ireland, at 10 per cent,
compared with Ireland, at 5.9 per cent,
and the varying age distribution of these
groups, is illustrated in Figure 26.

The age patterns were remarkably
similar in both jurisdictions, with a high
level of no religion amongst under 5 year
olds, followed by a decline in the school-
going years (5-14 age groups) and a
subsequent rise among persons in the
late teenage years and early twenties.
The rates declined steadily from the
early thirties onwards, and again more
steeply in the older age groups.

Map 11 displays the geographical
distribution of people with no religion.
The highest rates were found in the
eastern areas of Northern Ireland,
particularly in the areas adjacent to
Belfast, with 21 per cent of people in
North Down and 19 per cent in
Carrickfergus indicating no religion. In
Ireland, rates were highest in Dublin and
Galway cities (11 and 10 per cent
respectively), while the lowest
prevalence of no religion was found in
the midlands and north-west areas.


In Northern Ireland, although the
prevalence of no religion was highest
amongst the under fives (14 per cent),
it was also relatively high between the
ages of 20 and 39 (13 per cent);  in
Ireland it peaked among the 25-29
year old age group at 10 per cent.

Figure 27 shows the self-perceived health for
each main religious grouping compared with the
total population. While general health will be
examined later in this report, it is noted that in
both jurisdictions, and probably linked to their
younger age profile, people with no religion
experienced the highest levels of good health.

Household size

Figure 28 shows the average household size for
each main religious grouping. Overall, household
sizes were higher in Ireland (2.73 persons) than
in Northern Ireland (2.54 persons). In Northern
Ireland Catholics had the largest average
household size, at 2.76 persons, while in Ireland
the largest households were found among those
of Other Religions, at 2.95 persons.

This is further reflected in the proportion of
households with five or more people shown in
Figure 29. In Ireland, 17 per cent of Other
Religion households had five or more persons. In
Northern Ireland, 14 per cent of Catholic
households had five or more persons, compared
with 8.0 per cent of Protestant households.


The average size of
Protestant and Other
Christian households
in Ireland was larger
(2.83 persons) than in
Northern Ireland
(2.42 persons), and
larger than that of
Catholic households in
either jurisdiction
(2.74 and 2.76

Ethnicity



33


































The majority of people living on the
island of Ireland were of a White ethnic
background, which accounted for 98 per
cent of those usually resident in
Northern Ireland and 94 per cent of
those in Ireland.

Figure 30 shows the non-white minority
ethnic groups of Black, Asian and Other
(this includes those of mixed ethnicity or
who did not state their ethnic
background but excludes Irish
Travellers) as a proportion of each age
group in both jurisdictions. The majority
of people in these groups were in the 25
to 44 age group, reflecting the increase in
inward migration in recent decades with
associated high proportions of children,
while, in contrast, only 2.1 per cent of
those aged 65 and over in Ireland, and
0.3 per cent of those in Northern Ireland,
were in these ethnic groups.

The geographical distribution of these
minority ethnic groups as a percentage of
the total population is shown in Map 12.
The highest proportions of non-white
ethnic groups were found in Galway City
and the counties surrounding Dublin. In
Fingal, non-white ethnic groups
accounted for 9.2 per cent of all usual
residents. The lower proportions of non-
white ethnic groups across Northern
Ireland can also be seen, with Belfast
having the highest proportion (3.6 per
cent).



Non-white ethnic groups accounted for
1.7 per cent of the total population of
Northern Ireland and 5.8 per cent of
that of Ireland.

Marital status

When examined by ethnicity, the lowest combined rates of separation
and divorce were found amongst Asian ethnic groups in both
jurisdictions (Figure 32), with rates of 3.1 and 3.8 per cent in Ireland and
Northern Ireland respectively; the highest rates were among those of
Black ethnicity, at 8.1 and 11 per cent respectively. Those of Asian
background were also most likely to be married, with rates of 64 per cent
in Ireland and 65 per cent in Northern Ireland, compared with 48 per

Irish Travellers

There were 1,300 Irish
Travellers in Northern
Ireland, accounting for 0.1
per cent of the population,
compared with Ireland,
where the population of
29,500 made up 0.7 per
cent of usual residents. The
age distribution of Irish
Travellers in Figure 33 was
similar in both
jurisdictions.

It is notable that the
proportion of older
Travellers was higher in
Northern Ireland, with 6.4
per cent aged 65 and over
compared with 2.5 per cent
in Ireland; in both
jurisdictions, however,
older people accounted for
a greater share of the
overall population, at 12
per cent in Ireland and 15
per cent in Northern
Ireland respectively.

Religion

Figure 34 shows the
religion profile for Irish
Travellers in both
jurisdictions. While
predominantly Catholic, 3.4
per cent of Travellers in
Ireland and 10 per cent of
those in Northern Ireland
belonged to the Protestant
and Other Christian
religions.




Lower life expectancy amongst Irish Travellers is reflected in the
particularly low proportions in both jurisdictions aged 65 and
over; this is lower in Ireland (2.5 per cent) than in Northern
Ireland (6.4 per cent).

Figure 35 shows the main ethnic groups according to their country of birth. The
majority of those belonging to White ethnic groups were born in their country of
usual residence of Ireland (86%) or Northern Ireland (90%). Almost all Irish
Travellers in Ireland and 98 per cent of those in Northern Ireland were born in
Ireland or the UK.

While the majority of those belonging to other ethnic groups originated outside of
the EU, 34 per cent of those in Black ethnic groups in Ireland were born in the
country, double the proportion of those of Asian ethnicity born there (17 per cent).
The opposite could be found in Northern Ireland, with 21 per cent of those of Asian
background born there compared with 15 per cent among Black ethnic groups.
Those in the Other ethnic group category included people with mixed ethnicity and
accordingly were more likely than any other non-white ethnic group to be born and
living in the same jurisdiction.

The Black ethnic groups had the highest proportions of people originating in other
EU countries (including England, Scotland and Wales) with over a quarter of those
of non-African Black backgrounds in Northern Ireland born elsewhere in the EU.

In Ireland, less than 1.0 per cent of persons of Asian ethnicity originated in the rest
of the EU (excluding Great Britain); in excess of 80 per cent were born outside the
EU.





One in three
people in
Black ethnic
groups usually
resident in
Ireland were
born in
Ireland, more
than double
the equivalent
figure for
Northern
Ireland (15
per cent).

In Northern Ireland, 202,000 people, representing
11 per cent of usual residents, were born outside the
jurisdiction, while the comparable figure for Ireland
was 17 per cent, or 766,800 people.

Figure 36 shows the place of birth for these groups.
In Northern Ireland, 41 per cent of those born
elsewhere were born in England, Scotland or Wales,
with a further 23 per cent originating in the rest of
Europe. The corresponding figures for Ireland were
30 and 38 per cent respectively.

Residents of Ireland born in Northern Ireland and
Northern Ireland residents born in Ireland are
analysed in more detail on Page 38.

11 per cent of residents of Northern Ireland, and
17 per cent of residents of Ireland, were born
elsewhere.

Map 13 shows the geographical distribution of
those born elsewhere. Galway City had the highest
proportion of residents born elsewhere, with 25 per
cent, followed by Fingal, Donegal, Dublin City and
Monaghan, with more than one in five residents
born outside Ireland. Donegal and Monaghan had
particularly high numbers of residents born in
Northern Ireland. In Ireland five counties (Kilkenny,
Offaly, Limerick, Waterford and North Tipperary)
shared the lowest rate for residents born elsewhere
(13 per cent).

As the map clearly shows, the rates for residents
born elsewhere were generally lower in districts
across Northern Ireland, consistent with the lower
overall rate. The highest rates were found in the
LGDs of Fermanagh and Dungannon, where 16 per
cent of residents were born outside Northern
Ireland; the lowest rates were found in the
Ballymoney and Magherafelt areas (around 7 per
cent).

Of



























Of the total of 202,000 persons in
Northern Ireland who were born
elsewhere, 37,900 were born in Ireland,
representing almost 1 in 5 of the total.
In Ireland, in contrast, the 58,500
people born in Northern Ireland
accounted for a lower proportion
(around 8 per cent) of all those born
elsewhere.

Map 14 shows the distribution of the
population born in the neighbouring
jurisdiction, and clearly illustrates the
high concentrations in the border areas,
with rates declining with decreasing
proximity.

Apart from Great Britain and the island
of Ireland, the main place of origin of
those born elsewhere was Poland,
followed by Lithuania. The detail is
presented in Table 8. The United States,
Latvia and Nigeria also featured
strongly in Ireland, while India, the
United States and Germany did so in
Northern Ireland.

For Ireland, data refer to the language spoken at home.

Main languages spoken

Other than English and Irish, the main languages spoken by usual
residents of Ireland and Northern Ireland are shown in Table 9.  Polish
tops the list in both jurisdictions, accounting for 35 per cent of residents
of Northern Ireland whose main language was other than English or
Irish and 23 per cent of those resident in Ireland. Other languages which
featured strongly in both jurisdictions were Lithuanian, Russian,
Chinese, Latvian and Portuguese.

The Northern Ireland
census asked respondents
to indicate their ‘main
language’, while the
equivalent question in
Ireland asked if the person
spoke a language other
than English or Irish at
home, and if so what the
language was. Because of
these differences,
comparisons should be
treated with care.

In total, 495,700 (12 per
cent) people in Ireland
aged 3 and over indicated
that they spoke a language
other than English or Irish
at home; over a quarter of
those were born in
Ireland. In Northern
Ireland, the number
whose main language was
other than English or Irish
was 50,400 (2.9 per cent).

The age distribution of
this group is shown in
Figure 37. While the
numbers in Ireland are
significantly higher, the
age profile for both
jurisdictions shows the
majority of foreign
language speakers in the
25 to 44 year age groups,
reflecting the general age
profile of usual residents
who were born outside
the island of Ireland.






Health



40


































While a high proportion of the
population in both Ireland and Northern
Ireland enjoyed good health in 2011, the
proportion of those who considered their
health to be good or very good was
considerably higher in Ireland, as shown
in Figure 38.  In particular, 62 and 61 per
cent of males and females respectively in
Ireland considered they had very good
health, compared with 49 and 47 per
cent respectively in Northern Ireland.

At the opposite end of the scale, a total of
102,100 (5.6 per cent) persons in
Northern Ireland felt that their health
was bad or very bad compared with
69,700 (1.6 per cent) in Ireland,
indicating very different perceptions of
poor health between the jurisdictions.
Northern Ireland’s results for perceived
general health were, however, similar to
the UK average.

The geographical spread of people with
self-perceived bad or very bad health is
shown in Map 15, where the higher rates
of poor health across Northern Ireland
are apparent. Rates were highest in
Belfast (8.1 per cent), Strabane (7.2 per
cent) and Derry (6.9 per cent). Indeed,
across both jurisdictions the highest
rates of self-perceived bad health tended
to be found in urban areas, with Dublin
(2.1 per cent), Cork (2.2 per cent) and
Limerick (2.7 per cent) cities having the
highest perceived rates of poor health in
Ireland.


In both jurisdictions, males were more
likely than females to perceive their
health as very good and less likely to
perceive it as bad or very bad.

Figure 39 shows the proportions of self-perceived health of males and females at five-year age groups in
Ireland and Northern Ireland and illustrates similar levels of good health in both jurisdictions up to age
30. Beyond that, males and females in Ireland had higher rates than those in Northern Ireland, with the
gap in the rates steadily widening up to age 75, before gradually narrowing.  For instance, by age 60, 8
out of 10 women in Ireland regarded their health as good or very good, compared with 6 out of 10
women in Northern Ireland.

Figure 41  Change in unpaid carers since 2001/2

Ireland
Northern Ireland

The 2011 Census showed that there were 214,000
people, accounting for 12 per cent of usual
residents, providing unpaid care in Northern
Ireland. This was three times the proportion found
in Ireland across all age groups, where 4.1 per cent
of usual residents, 187,100 persons, were carers.
The higher proportion of carers in Northern Ireland
may be related to a combination of the older age
profile and higher prevalence of self-perceived bad
health as discussed in the previous pages. In
addition, differences in the phrasing of the census
questions could also have contributed to different
interpretations as to what constitutes unpaid care.

The age distributions of unpaid carers, shown in
Figure 40, were generally similar in both
jurisdictions, with caring more prevalent in the
middle years. Among those aged 50-54, for
instance, more than one in five people in Northern
Ireland (23 per cent) were carers, compared with
10 per cent in Ireland. In almost all age groups, with
the exception of those aged 80 and over in Northern
Ireland, females were more likely than males to
provide unpaid care.

Change in unpaid carers

Figure 41 shows the change over
the decade to 2011, with the
number of unpaid carers in
Ireland increasing at a faster rate;
growing by 23 per cent since the
2002 census, compared with 16
per cent growth in Northern
Ireland since 2001. Much of the
growth in both jurisdictions was
in the 65 and over age group,
among which the number of
carers increased by 49 per cent in
Ireland and 50 per cent in
Northern Ireland, compared with
overall growth in the population
in this age group of 23 per cent
and 18 per cent respectively.


Around half of carers, 52 per cent in Ireland and 47 per cent
in Northern Ireland, were aged between 40 and 59.

Hours spent providing
unpaid care

The majority of carers in both
jurisdictions provided between
1 and 19 hours care each week,
as shown in Figure 42. In
Northern Ireland, a total of
122,300 persons fell into this
category, accounting for 57 per
cent of carers, while in Ireland
88,100 persons (54 per cent of
those stating their hours) were
in this group.

A further 35,400 persons (17
per cent) in Northern Ireland
provided between 20 and 49
hours care per week, with a
similar number, 38,200 (23 per
cent), in Ireland.

In Northern Ireland, there were
56,300 people (26 per cent)
providing 50 or more hours of
unpaid care per week (more
than 7 hours per day),
compared with 38,000 (23 per
cent) in Ireland. The dominance
of the middle aged groups in
provision of this level of care is
evident in Figure 43, with more
than two thirds (67 per cent) of
this amount of care provided by
those in the 35-64 age groups
in Ireland and three-fifths (61
per cent) in Northern Ireland.
Females were the primary
providers of this amount of
care, with two out of three (67
per cent) carers in this category
female in Ireland and three-
fifths (60 per cent) in Northern
Ireland.



A total of 6.0 per cent of all females aged 45-54 in Northern
Ireland provided 50 or more hours unpaid care per week,
compared with 2.2 per cent of those in Ireland.

Young carers

A total of 4,300 children aged less
than 15 years (1.2 per cent of the
age group) were acting as unpaid
care providers in Northern
Ireland, of which 906 were aged
under 10, as shown in Figure 44.
In total, 443 children, or 10 per
cent of those doing so, were
providing at least 50 hours of
care per week.

In Ireland, 4,200 unpaid carers
were aged under 15 (0.4 per cent
of the age group), with 1,800 (44
per cent) younger than age 10. In
total, 149 children, or 3.5 per
cent of those doing so, were
providing 50 or more hours of
care per week.

Health of unpaid carers

Figure 45 shows the proportion
of unpaid carers who had self-
perceived bad health. In
Northern Ireland 9,100 unpaid
carers (4.3 per cent) perceived
themselves to be in bad or very
bad health, compared with 3,800
(2.0 per cent) in Ireland. The
proportion of carers in poor
health increased with age.  At any
given age, the proportion of
carers perceiving their health to
be bad or very bad was lower in
Ireland than in Northern Ireland.
For instance, in Ireland, 4.6 per
cent of carers aged over 65
perceived themselves to be in
poor health, while the figure in
Northern Ireland was 8.7 per
cent.

Economic status



45
































In the 2011 censuses, the questions and
methodologies used to compile data on
economic status differed in several important
aspects between the two jurisdictions. While
the Irish census used the question on
Principal Economic Status (PES), in Northern
Ireland the International Labour Organisation
(ILO) measure was used. Accordingly,
comparisons of economic indicators between
the two jurisdictions are difficult.

In order to make the comparisons between
the two jurisdictions more meaningful, a
special exercise has been undertaken to
convert the Irish data from the PES based
results to an ILO basis. The data in Table 10
for Ireland are based on this exercise, which is
described in Appendix 3.

Using this adapted ILO measure, it is
estimated that the total labour force in Ireland
in April 2011 was 2,261,300, of which
1,898,900 were at work and a further 362,400
were unemployed, giving an unemployment
rate of 16 per cent. In Northern Ireland, there
were 804,600 persons at work, and 65,200
unemployed, with an unemployment rate of
7.5 per cent.

Northern Ireland, unemployment among males
was 10 per cent, compared with the overall rate
of 7.5 per cent, while in Ireland it was estimated
at 19 per cent, compared with 16 per cent
overall. Female unemployment was
substantially lower in both jurisdictions, with a
rate of 5.2 per cent in Northern Ireland and an
estimated 12 per cent in Ireland.

Table 11 shows rates of
unemployment by area in Ireland and
Northern Ireland, giving the highest
and lowest rates for both
jurisdictions.

The highest rate in the table, 28 per
cent in Limerick City, was more than
five times that of the lowest, which
was 4.7 per cent in Castlereagh.
Other areas in Northern Ireland with
very low rates were Newtownabbey,
Antrim and North Down, while the
highest rate (12 per cent) was in
Derry. It is interesting to note that the
lowest rates in Ireland were on a par
with the highest in Northern Ireland.

Male unemployment

As illustrated on the previous page,
rates of male unemployment
exceeded those of females in both
jurisdictions. Map 16 shows rates of
unemployment for males by Local
Government District in Northern
Ireland and county and city council
areas in Ireland. The contrast
between the two jurisdictions is stark.

In Northern Ireland, the highest rates
were found in the north-west LGDs of
Derry (16 per cent), Limavady (14
per cent) and Strabane (14 per cent),
with the lowest rates in Castlereagh
(6.2 per cent) and North Down (6.7
per cent).

The darkest areas on the map all had
rates above 21 per cent. The high
rates in the South East of Ireland are
evident as are those in western
counties and the major cities outside
Dublin. Limerick City had the highest
rate of 32 per cent.

Table 12 shows the numbers of people at work aged
16-74 in each of the main industrial sectors (see
Appendix 1 for definitions), along with the share of
overall employment. There are strong similarities
between the two jurisdictions.

According to the Census 2011 results, the
Wholesale and Retail sector employed the highest
proportion of persons of all sectors in both
Northern Ireland and Ireland, although rates in
Northern Ireland (18 per cent) exceeded those in
Ireland (15 per cent).

Human health and social work was the second most
important sector, with 14 per cent of persons in
Northern Ireland and 11 per cent in Ireland,
followed by manufacturing, which accounted for 10
and 11 per cent respectively.

Maps 17 – 20 on Page 48 show the geographical
importance, in terms of proportion employed, of a
selection of industrial sectors across the island of
Ireland.

Map 17 shows the greater importance of
agriculture in Ireland (4.9 per cent), compared
with Northern Ireland (2.2 per cent), and
illustrates the difference between the east and
west of the island. Map 18 shows employment in
manufacturing and highlights its importance in
areas such as Dungannon (20 per cent),
Cookstown and Craigavon (both 16 per cent) in
Northern Ireland and Waterford City and County
(16 per cent) in Ireland.  Map 19 deals with
construction, which accounted for 8.2 per cent of
employment in Northern Ireland, compared with
4.9 per cent in Ireland, while Map 20 presents the
Wholesale and Retail Trade sector.

Taken together, the top three industrial
sectors accounted for 36 per cent of workers in
Ireland and 42 per cent of those in Northern
Ireland.

Occupation

The 2011 census results show that professional occupations formed the largest occupation group in
both jurisdictions (See Table 13), accounting for almost 1 in 5 workers aged 16-74 in Ireland (19 per
cent) and 17 per cent of those in Northern Ireland.  Figure 48 presents the distribution of workers by
broad occupation group and illustrates the strong similarities between the two jurisdictions,
particularly among managers and directors, and those in skilled trades occupations.

In Northern Ireland, there were proportionally more workers in the administrative, sales, and caring
and leisure occupations groups, while Ireland had proportionally more workers in the associate
professional group.

It is worth noting that information on occupation is not available for 4.4 per cent of workers in
Ireland (Northern Ireland has no not stated category), making some of the comparisons less
straightforward.

Figure 49 presents results on more detailed occupation groups, broken down by sex.

The administrative occupations group was the most important employer for females in both Northern
Ireland and Ireland, followed by the caring occupations.  For males, corporate managers and directors and
skilled trades were the most important groups in Ireland, while in Northern Ireland skilled electrical and
construction trades and elementary administration and service occupations were among the largest
groups.

The strong gender segregation in some occupations can be seen equally in both jurisdictions, with
secretarial occupations heavily dominated by females, while trades and plant operatives were almost
exclusively male occupations.  While both males and females were engaged in the managerial, health and
education professional occupations, males were predominant in the managerial group, whereas females
were more prevalent in the health and education occupations.

Education



52
































While the education and qualification systems that operate in both jurisdictions differ considerably, it is
still useful to compare overall census results in this important area. Table 14 presents the number of
persons aged 16 and over who had attained broad levels of education and qualifications. See Appendix 4
for more details.

In Ireland, 37 per cent of people had been educated to at most lower secondary level; in Northern
Ireland, which has an older population (lower levels of education are generally found among older
people), the rate was slightly higher at 41 per cent.  Those educated to level 2 and 3 in Northern Ireland,
which generally equates to upper secondary level in Ireland, represented 27 per cent of persons,
compared with 26 per cent in Ireland.

The percentage of persons educated to third level (degree or higher) stood at 24 per cent in both
Ireland and Northern Ireland, and Figure 50 presents these results by age. While Northern Ireland had a
higher percentage of persons in the older age groups (age 50 and above) educated to third level, among
those aged 20-34 the picture was reversed with higher rates seen in Ireland.

In Ireland, proportionally more males than females had been educated to at most lower secondary (39
per cent, compared with 35 per cent for females), while in Northern Ireland there was little difference
(40 and 41 per cent respectively), as shown in Figure 51.  In both the upper secondary and third level
categories, there were more females than males in both jurisdictions. Apprenticeships were dominated
by males, with 0.6 per cent of females in this category in Northern Ireland and 3.5 per cent in Ireland.

Figure 52 presents level of education by broad religious groups. Among Catholics, proportionally more
had been educated to third level in Northern Ireland than in Ireland (24 per cent, compared with 22
per cent), while among Protestant and Other Christians the reverse could be found, with 28 per cent in
Ireland educated to third level, compared with 22 per cent in Northern Ireland.

Those of Other religions tended to have higher levels of education and qualifications in both
jurisdictions, with 36 per cent in Northern Ireland and 41 per cent in Ireland educated to third level.
Similar results were found among those with no religion and in the not stated category. The younger
age profile of each of these groups was a likely contributing factor.

Housing



54
































As shown in Table 15, the 2011
Censuses showed that there were
around 2 million permanent
housing units in Ireland, of which
85 per cent were houses or
bungalows.  Northern Ireland had
around 747,000 dwelling units, of
which 9 out of 10 were houses or
bungalows.

Vacancy

Around 300,000 dwellings in
Ireland had no usual residents and
accordingly were vacant at the time
of the 2011 census, representing 15
per cent of the housing stock. This
was considerably more than in
Northern Ireland, where around
45,000 units were vacant at census
time, accounting for 6.0 per cent of
dwellings.

Map 21 shows the proportion of
vacant dwellings for each local
government area in both
jurisdictions. Vacancy rates were
relatively high in all western
counties and along the south and
south-east coasts of Ireland – areas
with a high proportion of holiday
homes; rates were highest in
Leitrim (31per cent) and Donegal
(29 per cent) and lowest in South
Dublin at 5.5 per cent.

As clearly illustrated, the vacancy
rate was generally lower across all
areas of Northern Ireland, with the
exception of the Causeway Coast,
where vacancy rates of 18 and 14
per cent were found in Moyle and
Coleraine LGDs respectively.

Housing

Despite the increasing popularity of
apartment living in both Northern Ireland
and Ireland over the past decade, detached
houses or bungalows remained the most
common type of accommodation in both
jurisdictions in 2011, as shown in Figure
53. In Northern Ireland, they accounted for
38 per cent of households, housing 43 per
cent of the population, while in Ireland 42
per cent of households and 46 per cent of
the population lived in detached properties.
Semi-detached and terraced housing were
proportionally more common in Northern
Ireland, with terraced properties in
particular accounting for 25 per cent of
dwellings, compared with 17 per cent of
those in Ireland.

Apartments and flats accounted for 11 per
cent of dwellings in Ireland, compared with
8.9 per cent of those in Northern Ireland.

Map 22 shows the distribution of houses or
bungalows, across the island with, as would
be expected, higher concentrations away
from the urban areas.

The 2011 Censuses showed that there were
1,649,400 private households occupied by
usual residents in Ireland and 703,300 in
Northern Ireland.

Figure 54 shows the breakdown by tenure.
In both jurisdictions, owner occupied with a
loan or mortgage was the most dominant
type of tenure, followed by owner occupied
without a loan or mortgage. Together these
represented two out of three homes in
Northern Ireland (67 per cent) and 70 per
cent of those in Ireland, with the highest
levels of owner-occupied tenure in the West
of Ireland.

The most striking difference between both
jurisdictions was for non-private or social
rented accommodation, which accounted for
15 per cent of dwellings in Northern Ireland,
compared with 8.7 per cent in Ireland. Map
23 shows the distribution of this group,
which varied widely across the island from a
high of 26 per cent in the Belfast LGD to a
low of 4.7 per cent in County Galway.

In Northern Ireland 2.5 per cent of
households lived rent free, compared with
1.5 per cent of those in Ireland.

Figure 55 shows the distribution of households
by number of rooms from 1971 to 2011. Over
this period the proportion of households with
five or more rooms increased from 63 per cent
to 79 per cent in Northern Ireland and from 46
per cent to 74 per cent in Ireland.

The total number of housing units increased by
127 per cent in Ireland between 1971 and
2011, while Northern Ireland witnessed an
increase of 65 per cent over the period.
Reflecting the recent increase in apartment
living, two and three room units experienced
higher than average growth over the period
2001/2 to 2011; increasing by 65 per cent in
Ireland and 19 per cent in Northern Ireland.



Central Heating

Figure 56 shows central heating by type of fuel
in both jurisdictions. It should be noted that
respondents in Northern Ireland could indicate
multiple or mixed fuel use (accounting for 13
per cent of the total), while those in Ireland
were asked for their main fuel only.

One third (33 per cent) of households in Ireland
indicated gas as their main fuel, around double the
proportion (17 per cent) solely using gas in
Northern Ireland. The reverse picture can be seen
for oil, with 43 per cent of households in Ireland
indicating it as their main fuel and 62 per cent of
those in Northern Ireland solely using oil.


Transport and travel


58
































The availability of cars and vans in
households is illustrated in Figure 57,
showing that 18 per cent of households
in Ireland and 23 per cent of those in
Northern Ireland did not have access to a
car or van. In both jurisdictions just over
two fifths of households had access to
one car or van only, while a higher
proportion of households in Ireland had
access to two cars or vans (34 per cent)
compared with Northern Ireland (27 per
cent).

In total, 82 per cent of households in
Ireland and 77 per cent in Northern
Ireland had at least one car or van
available.  However, this varies across
the different areas, as shown in Map 24.
In Ireland, Meath, at 90 per cent, had the
highest proportion of households with
access to at least one car or van, while
Dublin City had the lowest rate of 62 per
cent. In Northern Ireland, Belfast had the
lowest rate, at 60 per cent, while
Magherafelt and Banbridge had the
highest rate of 86 per cent.

Table 16, which illustrates the methods of travel
used by persons commuting to work, school or
college, shows car or van driving to be the most
common method. When taken together, all forms
of transport by car or van accounted for 63 per
cent of commuters in Ireland and 62 per cent of
those in Northern Ireland. Among commuters,
Ireland had higher proportions of pedestrians (15
per cent) and cyclists (2.2 per cent) than in
Northern Ireland (11 and 0.7 per cent
respectively), while a greater proportion in
Northern Ireland worked or studied mainly from
or at home (11 per cent compared with 3.0 per
cent in Ireland).

In total, bus and train commuters accounted for a
slightly higher proportion of commuters in
Northern Ireland (14 per cent) than in Ireland (13
per cent). Map 25 shows that in Ireland
proportions of bus and train users were highest in
the Dublin area, where more than one in five
commuters travelled by bus or train, and lowest
in Carlow (6.2 per cent) and Waterford City (4.9
per cent). In Northern Ireland, Ballymena had the
lowest proportion (9.4 per cent) and Belfast the
highest (17 per cent).

Figure 58 presents the age and sex profile of
these cross-border commuters and shows that
the majority (57 per cent) of commuters
travelling from Northern Ireland to Ireland were
male, whereas commuters in the opposite
direction were mainly female (54 per cent). The
age profiles were similar, with the majority in
the early working years; the largest cohort
travelling to Ireland from Northern Ireland were
males aged 25-34, while females in the same age
group were the most likely to commute to
Northern Ireland from Ireland.

Map 26 on Page 61, which shows the origin and
destination of cross-border commuters from
Ireland to work or study in Northern Ireland,
illustrates that the majority of those who
commuted to Northern Ireland were resident in
the border areas of Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan
and Louth. Their destinations, corresponding to
their places of work or study in Northern
Ireland, were mainly concentrated in the Belfast
and Derry LGDs, with further clusters in Newry,
Armagh, Craigavon, Dungannon, Enniskillen,
Omagh, Limavady, Strabane and Coleraine.

regularly commuted between
the jurisdictions for work or
study, with 6,500 travelling to
Ireland from Northern Ireland
and 8,300 travelling in the
other direction. The
characteristics of these people
are examined in the following
pages.

The corresponding data for commuters from
Northern Ireland to work or study in Ireland are
shown in Map 27 on Page 62. Again, while much
of the activity is in border areas, the usual
residence (or origin) of these commuters was
more widely spread across Northern Ireland.
The destination of these commuters is
concentrated in Dublin, with further clusters in
the towns of Letterkenny, Drogheda, Dundalk,
Cavan and Monaghan.






Proportionally twice as many (0.4 per cent)
Northern Ireland residents commuted to
Ireland to work or study as commuted from
Ireland to Northern Ireland (0.2 per cent).

Place of birth

As shown in Figure 59, of the 6,500 usual residents of Northern Ireland who commuted regularly to
Ireland for work or study, 20 per cent (1,300) were born in Ireland; this compared with 2.1 per cent
of the population generally. Of those who travelled from Ireland to work or study in Northern
Ireland, 37 per cent (3,100 persons) were born in Northern Ireland, compared with 1.3 per cent of
the population generally.

Religion

Table 17 shows the religion of cross-border commuters. Of the 6,500 regular commuters to Ireland
from Northern Ireland, 4,800 (74 per cent) were Catholics. This compared with 41 per cent of the
Northern Ireland population generally. Among northbound commuters, 10 per cent belonged to the
Protestant and other Christian religions category; this compared with 3.6 per cent of the population
generally.

Industry

As illustrated in Figure 60, the
distributions of cross-border workers
by industry were similar regardless of
their direction of travel. In terms of
employment, the most important
industry for cross-border commuters
was wholesale and retail, accounting for
16 per cent of persons travelling to
Ireland from Northern Ireland and 14
per cent commuting in the opposite
direction. Together, education and
health services accounted for 28 per
cent of those who commuted from
Ireland to work in Northern Ireland and
22 per cent of those commuting to work
in the opposite direction.

Occupation

Cross-border commuters were
proportionally more likely than the
general population to be working in
managerial and professional roles.
Together, managers, directors and
professionals accounted for 44 per cent
of workers in Ireland from Northern
Ireland, and 38 per cent of those from
Ireland commuting to work in Northern
Ireland.  Given the importance of the
health and education industries for
cross-border commuters, it is
unsurprising that the professional
occupations group was the most
important category for both sets of
workers. Figure 61 presents the
distributions by occupation and shows
that, in general, a higher percentage of
those travelling to Ireland from
Northern Ireland to work could be
found in managerial and professional
roles, while among those commuting to
Northern Ireland from Ireland there
was a greater number in occupational
groups requiring lower skill levels,
including operatives and elementary
trades.

Background Notes

Population
distribution
and change



Historical
census data

Historically a census of population has been carried out every 10
years in both Ireland and Northern Ireland, although Ireland has
carried out a census every 5 years from 1946 onwards. While a
decennial census of population has generally been carried out in
the same year in both Ireland and Northern Ireland, this has not
been the case on a number of occasions (notably in 2001/2, when
Ireland’s census was postponed to 2002 due to an outbreak of Foot
and Mouth disease and in 1936/7, when there was a gap of one
year between the census in Ireland in 1936 and Northern Ireland
in 1937).

In this section of the report, for the purposes of making historical
comparisons, the mid-year population estimates are used for
Northern Ireland to compare with the population from each
corresponding census in Ireland.

Population
density

Population density (population per square kilometre) is calculated
based on 2011 geographical areas.

De facto and
usually
resident
populations

The Northern Ireland census and subsequent mid-year population
estimates are based on the usually resident population, that is,
people are recorded at the address where they are usually resident
irrespective of where they are on census night.

For Ireland the main census results are reported on the de facto
population, that is, persons are enumerated where they spend
census night with a limited number of additional questions about
the usual residents at each address who were temporarily absent
on census night, thereby enabling key demographic statistics to be
produced on a usually resident basis. Although the main
demographic results included in this publication for Ireland are
based on the de facto population, some results are based on the
usually resident population and are indicated as such in the
relevant titles and text. In practice the difference between these de
facto and usually resident measures is not significant.

Usual
residence

For Ireland a person is considered usually resident at an address if
they have lived there for a continuous period of at least 12 months,
or arrived recently with the intention of staying for at least 12
months, with a general guidance that it is where they spend most
of their nightly rest. Further information can be found in the
explanatory notes on the back (Page 24) of the census form.

In the case of Northern Ireland, a usual resident is anyone who, on
census day, was in the UK and had stayed or intended to stay in the
UK for a period of 12 months or more, or had a permanent UK
address and was outside the UK and intended to be outside the UK
for less than 12 months.

Background Notes

Age
Classification
of age


Data are classified according to different age groups in the report
depending on the particular analysis, with the relevant age groups
referenced in the accompanying titles and text.

Median age


This refers to the age at which half of the population is younger
and half is older.

Dependency


In accordance with World Bank methodology, dependency is
defined for statistical purposes as people outside the working age
of 15-64. The age range for the young population is 0-14, while
older people are classed as those aged 65 and over. Dependency
ratios are used to give an indication of the age structure of a
population with young and older shown as a percentage of the
population of working age. The total dependency ratio is the sum
of the young and old ratios.

Young people
in broad
education
stages.


For the purpose of this analysis the population has been classified
in age-groups generally seen in the education process in Ireland,
namely 0-4 (pre-school), 5-12 (primary school), 13-15 (lower
secondary) and 16-18 (upper secondary). This classification differs
from classifications of young age groups used elsewhere in this
report.

Working age
groups



For the purpose of this section of the report, working age groups
have been defined as age 19-64, to cover the population from
second level education up to the age of 64. This classification
differs from classifications of working age used elsewhere in this
report.

Older age
groups

Aged 65 years and over.

Marital
Status

Marital status
of persons
aged 15 and
over

The analysis of marital status in this section relates to persons
aged 15 years and over. This may differ to data previously
published for Northern Ireland, where marital status is generally
reported in respect of persons aged 16 and over. In this respect, it
has been assumed that all 15-year-olds in Northern Ireland were
single.

Married


This refers to persons who indicated that they were married
(including re-married) and, in the case of the Northern Ireland
census, it includes those in a registered same-sex civil partnership.

Married
(including
separated)


This refers to persons who were married or separated (but still
legally married). For Northern Ireland, this includes those who
were in a registered same-sex civil partnership or separated from
such a partnership. For the purpose of some analysis presented in
this report, different groups have been presented together, for
example, to facilitate analysis where different broader
classifications were available for historical data in the two
jurisdictions.

Divorced
Divorce was introduced in Ireland in 1996. Data for the 1991
census included persons granted a divorce in another country.  For
Northern Ireland, this includes those formerly in a registered
same-sex civil partnership which is now legally dissolved.

Background Notes

Households
Household
composition


The determination of household composition is based on
responses to the question dealing with relationships within the
household.

Private
household


This comprised either one person living alone or a group of people
(not necessarily related) living at the same address with common
housekeeping arrangements - that is, sharing at least one meal a
day (Ireland), sharing cooking facilities (Northern Ireland) or
sharing a living room or sitting room. The total number of usual
residents includes all usual residents present on census night,
along with usual residents temporarily absent (for less than 12
months) on census night but excluding visitors to the household on
census night.

While this category excludes persons enumerated in a communal
establishment (hotels, hospitals, nursing homes etc.), staff of these
establishments who occupied separate living accommodation on
the premises were classified as private households. This latter
group were not included in private households in Northern Ireland
unless they were living in a completely separate building within
the grounds of the communal establishment

Permanent
private
household

A private household occupying a permanent dwelling such as a
house, flat or bed-sit.



Temporary
private
household

A private household occupying a caravan, mobile home or other
temporary dwelling.



Lone parent
households

In Ireland, a household comprising one parent together with one
or more usually resident never-married children.
In Northern Ireland, a lone-parent household comprises a lone-
parent family and no other person. A lone-parent family consists of
a father or mother with his or her child(ren), where the parent
does not have a spouse, same-sex civil partner or partner in the
household, and the child(ren) do not have a spouse, same-sex civil
partner or child in the household. A lone grandparent with his or
her grandchild(ren) is also considered a lone-parent family if there
are no children in the intervening generation present in the
household (note that children of the grandparent may also be
present if they are not parents or grandparents of the youngest
generation).

Household size
Consists of the total number of usually resident persons in a
household.

Religion
Classification
of religions
1861-2011

Although historical religion figures are readily available in census
reports, these have typically highlighted the figures for those
belonging to the Catholic religion and the three main Protestant
denominations, with most people belonging to Other Christian or
Christian-related religions, for example, Baptist, Christian and
Pentecostal, being included within Other Religions.  In order to
facilitate the production of an historical time series on as
consistent a basis as possible, an exercise has been undertaken to
apply the current approach to religion classification in Northern
Ireland to the historical data. By combining Protestants with those




70


Section
Title
Background Notes

belonging to Other Christian or Christian-related religions, this
approach has enabled the production of tabular output for the
period 1861 to 2011 for: Catholic; Protestant and Other Christian
(including Christian-related); Other Religions; and None or Not
Stated.

Ireland, Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales.

•
Rest of World includes all countries other than in Europe,
Africa and Asia. Includes North, South and Central America,
Australia and Oceania.

•

of Ireland for usual residents of Ireland and persons born
outside of Northern Ireland for usual residents of Northern
Ireland.

Language
Language other
than English or
Irish

For Ireland the census question (Q.15) asked respondents if they
spoke a language other than English or Irish at home and, if so,
what that language was. In Northern Ireland the census question
(Q19) asked respondents what their main language was.

Data presented relate to persons aged 3 years and over whose
main language/language spoken at home was other than English
or Irish.

Health
General health
For Ireland data are based on the de facto population on census
night, excluding ‘not stated’, that is, persons who did not respond
to the question on general health.

For Northern Ireland data are based on the usually resident
population as defined earlier.

Unpaid
carers

Unpaid carers













For Ireland question 22 asked respondents if they provided
‘regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a
long-term illness, health problem or disability’; it included
problems due to old age while ‘help’ was defined as including help
with basic tasks such as feeding or dressing. Carers allowance /
benefit was not considered to be pay for the purpose of this
question.

For Northern Ireland question 25 asked respondents if they looked
after or gave any help or support to family members, friends,
neighbours or others because of either long-term physical or
mental ill-health, disability or problems related to old age (which
had lasted or were expected to last for at least 12 months),
excluding help provided as part of paid employment.

Young carers
Persons aged 14 years or younger who indicated that they
provided unpaid care.

Economic
status

Methodology
In the 2011 census the questions and methodologies used to
compile data on economic status in Ireland and Northern Ireland
differed in several important aspects. While in Ireland the question
on Principal Economic Status (PES) was used, in Northern Ireland
the International Labour Organisation (ILO) measure was used. In
order to facilitate comparison between data collected using these
different methodologies, a conversion exercise was undertaken to
convert the data for Ireland to an ILO basis. A full explanation of
this exercise is described in Appendix 3.

At work
Under the ILO criteria, employment is defined as persons who
worked in the week before the survey for one hour or more for
payment or profit (including work on the family farm or business)
including all persons who had a job but were not at work because
of illness, holidays etc. during the period. The data include all
persons in the 16 - 74 year age group who met these criteria.

Unemployed
Under the ILO criteria, unemployment is defined as persons who,
in the week before the survey:

•
were without work;

•
were available for work within the next two weeks; and

•
had taken specific steps in the preceding four weeks to find
work.

The data include all persons in the 16 - 74 year age group who met
these criteria.

Labour force
Persons at work or unemployed, as defined above.

Unemployment
rate

Unemployed as a proportion of the labour force.

Industry
Industry
The term industry used for Census of Population purposes is
synonymous with the term “sector of economic activity” and is not
confined to manufacturing industry. For employees the basis of the
industrial classification is the business or profession of their
employer; in the case of self-employed persons it is the nature of
their own business or profession. Further information on this and
other related topics (including occupation), along with a detailed
outlay of the complete classification systems used, can be found in
Appendices 3 to 10 of the Census 2011 report “This is Ireland Part
2.”

Classification
of industry

For Ireland the industry coding used in this publication is NACE
REV2 which is comprised of 615 classes at 4-digit level.

In Northern Ireland the industry categorisation is based on the UK
Standard Industrial Classifications of Economic Activities
(SIC2007) which corresponds to NACE REV 2 at four digit level and
above.

The following table outlines the headings used in this report and
the corresponding 4-digit NACE codes:

At work
The data on occupations relate to all persons in the 16 - 74 year
age group who were at work.

The data for Ireland relate to ‘persons working for payment or
profit’ in accordance with responses to census question on
Principal Economic Status (Q. 27).

Education
Classifications
used

The education and qualification systems that operate in Ireland
and Northern Ireland vary considerably. Full details of the
categories which are used in presenting the data in this section of
the publication are set out in Appendix 4.

Housing
Permanent
housing stock






The total number of permanent residential dwellings that were
available for occupancy at the time of the census; this includes
holiday homes, vacant houses or apartments and dwellings
temporarily absent on Census night, but excludes communal
establishments, temporary private households (for example,
caravans and mobile homes) and dwellings categorised as derelict
or under construction.

Vacant
dwellings


Refers to permanent housing units which were unoccupied by
usual residents on census night. Dwellings under construction and
derelict properties were excluded, as were dwellings where the
usual residents were temporarily absent.

Holiday homes
For Ireland, holiday homes are categorised as dwellings that are
only occasionally occupied; while they are mainly found in rural
areas this group can also include city apartments used for weekend
breaks etc. Enumerators were instructed to consult with
neighbours as to whether a dwelling was used as a holiday home.

In Northern Ireland’s outputs, no distinction has been made
between holiday homes and other vacant properties.

Vacancy rates
Vacant dwellings as a percentage of the total housing stock.

Tenure


Refers to whether the accommodation is owned or rented and to
the type of landlord of rented properties.

Rented
privately

Refers to accommodation rented from a private landlord.

Non-private/
social rented

For Ireland this refers to properties rented from a Local Authority
or Voluntary body.  For Northern Ireland this refers to properties
rented from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, a housing
association or a charitable trust.

Central heating


For Ireland question H6 asked the main type of fuel used for
central heating, asking respondents to select one option only.

For Northern Ireland question H11 asked for the type of central
heating, asking respondents to indicate all of the options that
applied. The mixed category refers to accommodation where more
than one type of central heating was selected on the census form.
Accordingly the two sets of results are not directly comparable.




75


Section
Title
Background Notes

Travel to
work,
school &
college

Cross-border
commuters

For Ireland this category refers to persons who indicated that their
place of work, school or study (Q34) was in Northern Ireland.

For Northern Ireland (Q43) this category refers to persons who
travelled to an address in Ireland for their main work or study.

Geography
County
For Ireland the layer of geography used for the maps is the Local
Authority Administrative area. This corresponds to LAU-1 in the
NUTS classification, of which there are 34 subdivisions
corresponding to the 34 administrative counties and cities (County
and City Councils).

Local
Government
District (LGD)

For Northern Ireland the layer of geography used is the Local
Government District (LGD); this also corresponds to LAU-1 in the
NUTS classification, of which there are 26 subdivisions,
corresponding to the 26 LGDs.

Greater Dublin
Area

This refers to Dublin city (as legally defined) together with its
suburbs in the three adjacent counties of Dun Laoghaire-
Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin.

City
For Ireland this refers to the areas administered by Dublin, Cork,
Galway, Limerick and Waterford City councils. For example, Dublin
city refers to that area administered by Dublin city council and as
such does not include some of the suburbs of the city which are
located in the surrounding administrative areas of Dun Laoghaire-
Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin.

The differences in the geographic classification of Local
Government District in Northern Ireland should be noted; in
particular, this classification does not use city boundaries.
Consequently, comparisons between city areas in Northern Ireland
were not possible as part of this publication.

Dublin
commuter belt

Refers to the Greater Dublin Area (defined above) and the
surrounding counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.

Appendix 3

Unemployment – ILO and PES approaches

Different approaches were used in the measurement of unemployment in the censuses in Ireland and
Northern Ireland in 2011. While the official measure of unemployment in Ireland is based on the
International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition (whereby people must satisfy certain conditions
before they are deemed to be unemployed), the census measure of unemployment was based on a
question on Principal Economic Status (PES) (where respondents ticked one of a range of options to
indicate whether they were at work, unemployed, a student, homemaker, retired etc. See census
Question 27). In Northern Ireland, the ILO measure was used in the census.

In order to produce comparable census data for Ireland and Northern Ireland, the PES based measure
of unemployment in Ireland has been adjusted to an ILO basis. The methodology mapped PES and ILO
data from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) and the 2002 census, both of which
collected data using both approaches, and applied the changes in the QNHS distributions between
2002 and 2011 to the 2011 census data.

Specifically, a table of PES by ILO rates was extracted from the 2002 Quarter 2 and 2011 Quarter 2
QNHS data at Regional Authority level, for men and women (Note that in both years Quarter 2 data
corresponded to the period in which the census was undertaken).  A similar matrix was extracted
from the 2002 census (when both ILO and PES measures were captured) at Electoral Division (ED)
level. The changes in the QNHS distributions between 2002 and 2011 were applied to the relevant ED
census 2002 distributions; giving 2011 ED based PES/ILO distributions. These were then applied to
every Small Area (SA) within each ED to convert the PES data to an ILO basis. This was then
summarised to County level.

Appendix 4

Education

The educational and qualification systems that operate in Ireland and Northern Ireland differ
considerably, as did the census questions asked in both jurisdictions in 2011. In Ireland, the census
question asked respondents to identify their highest level of education completed, while in Northern
Ireland the question asked for qualifications held. In order to produce comparable census data for
Ireland and Northern Ireland, a mapping exercise was carried out to identify comparable levels of
educational qualification between the two sets of census data.

After consultation with NISRA and Department of Education and Skills, an exercise was carried out to
compare the different levels of educational qualification in the two jurisdictions with reference to the
data sought in the relevant census questions. Given the differences in the qualifications awarded,
particularly at second level, it was possible to map the qualifications, and therefore the census results,
at a high level only, as presented in the table below, which also references the qualification levels
from the census questions which are included in each grouping.

Northern Ireland data were sourced from NISRA’s 2011 Census Table DC5101NI ‘Highest level of
qualification by age by sex for all usual residents aged 16 and over’ and data for Ireland were
compiled in line with the classifications used in this report and the categories outlined in the table
below.
